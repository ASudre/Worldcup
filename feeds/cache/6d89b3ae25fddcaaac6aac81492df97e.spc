<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ghana 2, USA 1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States couldn&#8217;t muster one last comeback as Ghana kept African hopes alive  with a 2-1 victory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Black Stars continued America&#8217;s early-game woes when Kevin-Prince Boateng beat Tim Howard in the fifth minute with a rocket from 16 yards out. It was the third time in the World Cup the USA has given up a goal before the 20th minute.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Landon Donovan equalized from the penalty spot midway through the second half when Clint Dempsey was taken down inside the box. Regular time ended with the two sides deadlocked and extra time ensued. But the match didn&#8217;t stay tied for long when the USA defense fell asleep again three minutes into the extra period and Asamoah Gyan put the Black Stars ahead for good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite building a reputation for last-minute comebacks the Americans&#8217; ran out of gas. &#8220;We tried to push and push,&#8221; U.S. captain Carlos Bocanegra said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if we just didn&#8217;t have anything left because we had been pushing so much the entire tournament.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ghana becomes only the third African nation ever to advance to the quarterfinals. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made everybody proud,&#8221; Gyan said. &#8220;Not Ghana alone, but all of Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Uruguay 2, South Korea 1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Uruguay became the first team to book their ticket to the quarterfinals with a 2-1 win over South Korea.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">South Korea almost took an early lead when Park Chu-Young&#8217;s free kick ricocheted off the woodwork in the fifth minute. But it was Uruguay who got the breakthrough three minutes later when Luis Suarez, who&#8217;s having a masterful tournament, capitalized on a South Korean goalkeeping error  and buried the ball into an empty net from a tight angle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Red Devils equalized in the 68th minute with a headed goal in the midst of a wintery mix. Suarez was the hero for his country once again 10 minutes from time when, from the corner of the penalty area, the Ajax striker&#8217;s bending shot glanced off the post and into the net.</p>

After watching the Italian national team&#8217;s disastrous exit from the World Cup, I could not help but think that such a flaccid performance was required not just once, but twice.  Why?  The myth of the 2006 champions has punished la Nazionale for far too long, and such a powerful story like being &#8216;i campioni del [...]

<p style="text-align: left;">After watching the Italian national team&#8217;s disastrous exit from the World Cup, I could not help but think that such a flaccid performance was required not just once, but twice.  Why?  The myth of the 2006 champions has punished la Nazionale for far too long, and such a powerful story like being &#8216;i campioni del mondo&#8217; needed to be really shaken out of everyone&#8217;s minds.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p>What is this myth?  It is the continued idea that the 2006 team was perfect and the same formula would produce similar, if not victorious results.</p>
<p>I am not saying the great players of the winning campaign four years ago were not great.  They were, and their lifting of the trophy was deserved.  However, the players of Germany 2006, and more importantly, the near identical tactics to go with them, were so apocalyptically bad in the following tournaments that they needed to be unequivocally humiliated.</p>
<p>But to shatter the  continued reliance on essentially the same team, this ridiculous humbling had to happen twice.  What are the twin catastrophes?</p>
<p>The first requisite effort was the 2008 European championship where gli Azzurri whimpered out of the penalty shoot out with Spain and scarcely made an impact on anybody&#8217;s mind, and the second was the three winless games of South Africa 2010.</p>
<p>Why suffer the pain of two defeats?  Why not learn from 2008 and rebuild to be competitive in two years time?  They probably should and would have, but for one reason: In 2008, the exit was a tragic.  </p>
<p>Italy had a team of then world class players: Luca Toni couldn&#8217;t stop scoring for Bayern, Pirlo could still dictate a game from the midfield like nobody else (except for Xavi), Buffon was superman, the creative attacker Cassano had been recalled, De Rossi could run and tackle his way through a small army, etc.</p>
<p>Italy had an excuse, and it wasn&#8217;t their average players (as it was most recently).  It was a penalty shoot out that had them eliminated after all, a bit of luck &#8212; tragedy.  Not that Spain didn&#8217;t fully and overwhelmingly deserve their victory, but Italy weren&#8217;t consistently outplayed by mediocre teams as in 2010.  </p>
<p>1 win, 2 draws and a loss against France, Spain, Romania and Holland in 2008 is surely better than 2 draws and a loss against Paraguay, New Zealand, and Slovakia in 2010.</p>
<p>But in 2010 the exit was tragicomic.  Why?  The same core that failed in 2008 was given the green light to fail again.  The starting XI of Thursday&#8217;s match contained 5 non-2006 players, and had Buffon and Pirlo been healthy, that number would have been only 3.  </p>
<p>The result of the reliance on them was summed up midway through the first half when Lippi was seen giving instructions to a panting Gattuso.  This is the same player who ran away Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s threat in the 2007 champions league, now huffing for breath a third of the way through a game &#8212; tragicomic.</p>
<p>Pirlo was the only 2006 player who looked like he could still make a game his own, as Italy only came alive for the thirty minutes (in three games) he ran the show from the midfield.  </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not take Pirlo&#8217;s inspiring play and lament, &#8220;Oh, if only Pirlo had been healthy, surely Italy would have reached the semis at least.&#8221;  Absolutely not.  This is the exact same interpretation of 2008, and here one cannot view Italy&#8217;s loss as a tragedy.</p>
<p>But far more importantly, the tactics of 2006 were used massively inappropriately, and hopeful the disastrous performances will prevent this from happening again with immediate effect.  While Grosso, Materazzi, Cannavaro, Zambrotta and Buffon in 2006 will go down as one of the best defense units in World Cup history, attempting to use the same &#8220;defense first&#8221; idea with a outrageously weaker back line leads to 5 goals in three games against average sides.</p>
<p>It is as if Lippi took the stereotype of Italy being defense-minded seriously, even when it clearly hurt their chances. Similarly, the continued traditional reliance on Juventus players, even in a year where they cannot even qualify for the Champions League, was similarly appalling.</p>
<p>While I do not wish to join the chorus of &#8220;Balotelli + Cassano in Nazionale&#8221; voices, I will say there were numerous teams with Italian players on them that produced better results all season than the Juve group, and they at least merited a chance with gli Azzurri.</p>
<p>This is not to say the entire 2006 class minus Pirlo must leave before Euro 2012.  De Rossi and Buffon especially will still be crucial players.</p>
<p>But this is a moment of catharsis for Italy.  The ridiculous tactical and defensive choices, the anti-creative attacking selection, the reliance on 2006 veterans, the belief that Juventus = Italy &#8212; all of this can now end without dissent from the media, fans or the team itself.  </p>
<p>This is why the catastrophe had to happen twice.  Once was not enough to arouse the recognition of the problems in near everything from players to coaching.  Two times surely will awaken everyone to how the myths of 2006 preemptively ruined the two successive chances for major honors for La Nazionale.</p>

<p>The start of the knockout stages always makes me rather sad. Because it signals that the end of another World Cup isn&#8217;t too far away, but on the plus side, we get to see some of the best nations in the world attempt to become a hero. I&#8217;m sure most of you American readers are preparing yourself for the big game tonight, and with USA finishing top there has never been a better chance in moderns times for America to really challenge at the top stage. The fixtures for the last 16 have just came up on the screen and I think this is an exciting draw and although this has been a strange world cup in terms of talking points, it hasn&#8217;t lost any of it&#8217;s excitement or enthusiasm, and we are seeing football reach out to even more people. But enough of the analytical crap of how good football is, we have the first knockout game of the tournament right now! The impressive Uruguay come up against a South Korean side that can always cause problems. I will be watching from England on ITV1 and you can follow me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/Clusks">@Clusks</a> or leave a comment below:</p>
<p>- England fans seem confident we&#8217;re going to beat the German&#8217;s, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that this is more of the underestimating that the previous group opponents were given. If Barry plays his defensive midfielder role like he did against Slovenia, Oezil will rip the team to shreds, as he was too keen to break forward &#8211; the problem that often hindered a Gerrard/Lampard partnership. I can&#8217;t call it though, I think the teams are even, England have the edge in experience, but the pace of the German&#8217;s can cause the English centre backs a lot of problems. Everyone seems to be talking about penalty shoot outs prior to this game, but I think the game won&#8217;t go that far, one team is going to take it, it just depends which one.</p>
<p>- The fallout of the World Cup is often the players who have impressed in order to be snapped up by the big teams. So far, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Oezil and Portugal goalkeeper Eduardo have been some of the players I reckon may have a chance of a big transfer. There&#8217;s been a few, but those three in particular seem to fit the bill.</p>
<p>- In terms of this game, I can&#8217;t see past Uruguay, South Korea were undone 4-1 by Argentina, and Uruguay have a lot of pace up front that is similar to Argentina. I&#8217;ve put a bet on Forlan to be first goalscorer at 4/1, he was brilliant in the South Africa game and in my opinion if you&#8217;re going to name the top 20 players in the world at the moment, he would be in it. Maybe even top 10! ITV are giving a video segment about Diego Forlan at Manchester United, they ALWAYS mention that every time he plays, but let&#8217;s face it, it was one of those things, just a young player making a step up too fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-3018"></span></p>
<p>- Key man watch: South Korea rely upon Ji-Sung-Park quite a bit and look to him to provide a spark, I&#8217;m sure Uruguay will be looking to shut him down, although don&#8217;t let that take anything away from this under rated side. As for Uruguay, Diego Lugano is a rock at the back and he is also good in the air so any set piece could see get a goal.</p>
<p>- Craig Burley is the co-commentator for ITV, if you&#8217;ve never heard him before, he&#8217;s a former Scotland international that is quite critical, but he is better than listening to some of the other commentators in this country. I wish the UK commentators were like Italy, Spain, Mexico or Argentina, those guys go mental at any goal. My favourite goal of all time is Zidane&#8217;s in the Champion&#8217;s League final against Leverkusen, it was made even better when I looked it up on Youtube, it sounds like there are about six guys in a tiny room jumping about, screaming their heads off.</p>
<p>- Korea national anthem &#8211; while the majority of the players put their hand on their heard Jung-Woo-Kim gives an American military style salute &#8211; God bless South Korea!</p>
<p>- Commentator made a good point there, he said &#8220;this is the point where the World Cup get&#8217;s serious&#8221;. At first I thought that was a load of rubbish, but in truth a lot of the party atmosphere we see in the group games goes, as pure tension takes over.</p>
<p>- Also if you want a last minute bet tip, put under 2.5 goals for this game, since it&#8217;s the first one in the knockouts you can expect something a bit cagey, and they are also both good teams that will fancy their chances.</p>
<p><strong>Kick Off!</strong></p>
<p>1 Mins: Oh god. First knockout stage game and look at all the empty seats once again. FIFA really need to sort out the pricing for Brazil 2014, just make it cheaper you muppets.</p>
<p>2 Mins: Within 2 minutes my two key men clash! Park has space to run into the Uruguay half but Lugano stands his group and effortlessly wins the ball back for his country. I think Lugano can edge his way onto list of top stars of the tournament, Uruguay are the only team left in this World Cup that haven&#8217;t conceded a goal.</p>
<p>5 Mins: South Korea win a free kick in a good position, and after an age waiting for it to be taken Chu-Young Park takes it and hits the outside of the post. Keeper was beaten there.</p>
<p>6 Mins: South Korea are nervous at the back, as there is a scramble in the middle of their box as three defenders gave their best tribute to the three stooges, as they struggled to get the ball out. It eventually fell to Forlan, but his tame shot was gathered by the keeper.</p>
<p>8 Mins: <strong>GOAL! SUAREZ!</strong> Dammit Forlan, don&#8217;t you get on the wing to pass the ball, you should be scoring it and making me money. Uruguay have a patient build up, and Cavani plays an odd ball that sends Forlan out wide, it&#8217;s a lovely touch by the Atletico Madrid player to take him past his marker, and he hit&#8217;s a nothing ball across the box which has the defenders just watching and the goalkeeper scrambling. It eventually falls to Ajax&#8217;s Suarez who can easily tap it in. 1-0 to Uruguay.</p>
<p>- I heard last season Barcelona were lining up Suarez to replace Henry at one point, so I wanted to see what he was all about. Every time I have watched him play, he&#8217;s never quite lived up to the billing that people have given him, but he lost his marker easy there and got a good goal. Will be very difficult for South Korea from here.</p>
<p>13 Mins: South Korea are struggling with the counter, much like they did against Argentina, it appears that they haven&#8217;t quite grasped the South American style. Cavani was able to break easy there, and played a good ball out to Suarez who attempted to beat his man but was unable to. In the end, it fell to Arevalo who attempted the volley but it went over. Still, with the way that ball was dropping, I don&#8217;t think there would be anyone who wouldn&#8217;t want to belt that.</p>
<p>- Latin American teams this year are looking better than ever, it isn&#8217;t just Brazil and Argentina that are getting all the attention.</p>
<p>21 Mins: Uruguay show no nerves at all here, very comfortable and patient, they are controlling the pace of the game. As things stand, they look happy to just slow things down for a while</p>
<p>24 Mins: A lovely back heel from Suarez as he almost set Forlan on his way in another counter attack, but Uruguay were forced to hold the ball up. Still, they look to have the advantage over the Asians in every way so far.</p>
<p>27 Mins: Korea almost got caught there Jung-Soo Lee spent too long on the ball, and the tackle almost set Suarez away, but he was flagged offside. A bit of a let off really, South Korea aren&#8217;t really offering anything at the moment and Uruguay look very happy.</p>
<p>30 Mins: Oh dear, the replay has finally came up of the Suarez offside mentioned above, he was actually onside. A true let off for Korea. Korea have finally had their first bit of excitement through Park-Ji Sung though! He breaks down the left and attempts to put the ball into the box, but Arevalo is able to scrambling it away.</p>
<p>31 Mins: Chu-Young Park has South Korea&#8217;s best effort from open play so far, a swerving shot fr0m outside the area just goes past the diving Muslera in the Uruguay goal. Hopefully that will kick them gear, I bet the millions watching back at home aren&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<p>35 Mins: Chung-Yong Lee could of had a crack there, but was unselfish and tried to play a team mate in who gave away the foul. Seemed to open up there, I&#8217;d like to see one of the Korean attackers really take the game by the scruff of the neck and get at them.</p>
<p>37 Mins: For all my Korea bashing, that are starting to liven up a bit now and they&#8217;re pushing Uruguay deeper into their own half. Also, the pitch looks terrible.</p>
<p>38 Mins: Jung-Woo is the first player to get a yellow card, good decision from the referee who is from Germany. From the freekick, it is hit into a lonely Suarez, who somehow manages to get a header in while being marked by two players. Suarez isn&#8217;t exactly Uruguay&#8217;s answer to Luca Toni&#8230;</p>
<p>- I wonder if Uruguay could keep their discipline if they concede here, they haven&#8217;t so far at this tournament so they&#8217;ll be starting to forget what it feels like.</p>
<p>41 Mins: Du-Ri Cha (a right back) has one of the most ambitious shots of the tournament and although it has a bit of dip on, it is still well over the bar. Not even the commentator’s yelp of excitement could spice that one up.</p>
<p>44 Mins: A handball penalty shout, as Uruguay get on the break again, with Maxi Pereira heavily involved, he plays a beautiful flick over the defenders head then attempts to volley the ball and it looked like it hit the defenders hand in the box. Don&#8217;t think it was intentional, but those can be given. Replay suggests that he did have his hand out, I would have given that (if I had the benefit of video replay).</p>
<p>45 Mins: Cha, the right back from four minutes ago, has had another dig at goal but no surprise to see it go over the bar. You&#8217;re not Maicon.</p>
<p><strong>Half Time!</strong></p>
<p>- Uruguay go in at half time with the lead, they started out fast and then looked to hit the Korean&#8217;s on the counter attack. South Korea aren&#8217;t really offering too much to make the defence panic, and instead, Uruguay look very well organised and hard to break down. I can&#8217;t see much changing in the early parts of the second half, and we will see how good the Uruguay defence truly is when Korea are forced into throwing everything at them.</p>
<p>- I keep needing to correct myself, every time I go to write Diego Forlan&#8217;s name I put Forland. I also think I&#8217;m handling the Korean players names quite well considering I&#8217;m not too familar with the team.</p>
<p>- The major talking point in England right now is how many pairs of glasses does Edgar Davids actually have? Every single game he is analysing for ITV he brings out a different style. He must have packed an extra suitcase full of them. He does look quite bored though, I&#8217;m guessing he got that job with ITV because BBC sgot Seedorf &#8211; &#8220;I see your Seedorf and raise you Davids&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Adrian Chiles actually made a funny joke! He questioned Edgar Davids on what he would do with Korea by saying &#8220;Edgar, I now name you as South Korea coach&#8230;before Sven Goran Eriksson takes the job &#8211; what would you do here?&#8217;. Ha ha &#8211; Sven loves money. Sven, Juande Ramos and Felipe Scolari &#8211; they could buy a small island between them.</p>
<p><strong>Second Half Kick Off!</strong></p>
<p>46 Mins: Would be slightly ironic now if Sven took the South Korea job.</p>
<p>48 Mins: Main observation so far is some of the frantic Uruguayan flag waving in the front row, two people going for it.</p>
<p>49 Mins: Not the sort of thing you want to do at the start of a second half when you&#8217;re losing, South Korea gift the ball to Suarez, but his shot is tame.</p>
<p>50 Mins: Good chance for Korea there, the left back Lee-Young Pyo makes an great run down the left and the ball in is a dangerous one that is left by Chu-Young Park, but Uruguay are able to clear.</p>
<p>52 Mins: Another decent chance for Chu-Young Park, but he smashes it over the bar as he attempted to put everything into it. Still, this is good from Korea, a lot more aggressive on their behalf.</p>
<p>53 Mins: A deep freekick from Ki loops in the air, and all Muslera can do is tip it out for a corner. Korea need to keep up the pressure on goal.</p>
<p>55 Mins: Diego Lugano doesn&#8217;t lead by example here, as he is almost caught out by Park-Ji Sung and the ball eventually falls to C-Y Park again, but his shot is blocked. Uruguay maybe getting a bit nervous at the back? They&#8217;re certainly sitting back here, a lot like Greece against Argentina.</p>
<p>59 Mins: Some more good work by Korea as they pressure the right wing, and Cha is able to get forward and play a good ball into the head of Park-Ji Sung, but the header doesn&#8217;t have enough power on it. Muslera gives the Uruguayan press a picture for tomorrow’s papers, as he over emphasizes the dive to get the ball.</p>
<p>61 Mins: First substitution for Korea, Jae-Sung Kim is off and on comes former Middlesbrough man Dong-Gook Lee.</p>
<p>64 Mins: A good cross in from Ki there, but there isn&#8217;t a great deal in the box and Uruguay can clear through Lugano.</p>
<p>67 Mins: A lot of heavy rain coming down at the stadium, maybe time to go to a more direct game.</p>
<p>68 Mins: <strong>GOAL! C-Y LEE!</strong> Well the rain may have played a part, as it is a direct ball from a freekick that has got the goal and the Uruguayan defence looks lost. Muslera is at fault for the goal, he went into no man’s land as the ball deflected up and into the path of Bolton&#8217;s Chung-Yong Lee for an easy header to score. This changes the game, Uruguay won&#8217;t want to go to extra time here and will want to get the victory fast, South Korea on the other hand will feel they can win this one as they have shaken the South Americans.</p>
<p>71 Mins: Another chance for C-Y Lee! A good pass into the Korean gives him time to line up his shot, but he gets it all wrong and side foots it low and straight at the goal keeper. I wonder if Uruguay can respond after defending for so long. South Korea look the better side now. Just had a replay from a Forlan freekick previously, where it looked like the goal keeper had maybe taken the ball over the line. Hard to tell, I don&#8217;t think the entire ball was over.</p>
<p>73 Mins: Poor defending from South Korea, Suarez is just onside and attempts to get the ball in the box, but his strike becomes a shot on goal that Sung-Ryong Jung is forced to punch out.</p>
<p>74 Mins: South Korea are having a mare at defending, a long ball is thumped into Suarez, and one player is being lazy and not getting out which plays the Ajax man onside in space, but he can&#8217;t do anything with his chance.</p>
<p>75 Mins: Substitute for Uruguay, Pereira is off and on comes the youngster Lodeiro. Moments later, a decent chance for Forlan who is in space but he scuffs his shot. A great game for the final fifteen minutes here, the rain could be a deciding factor.</p>
<p>79 Mins: I can see quite a lot of people gathering on the stairs in the crowd, where the hell are they going?!</p>
<p>80 Mins: A session of Uruguay corners here. Is everyone avoiding the rain here? It&#8217;s mental, there’s more empty seats now than at the start.</p>
<p>80 Mins: <strong>GOAL! SUAREZ!</strong> Another contender for goal of the tournament, South Korea can&#8217;t fully clear the corner and Suarez has the ball just inside the left side of the box, he is able to beat his man and curls his shot perfectly into the side of the goal, the stadium goes silent as the ball travels through the air before hitting the post and going in. Brilliant from Suarez, I can&#8217;t see Korea replying this time. 2-1 to the South Americans.</p>
<p>84 Mins: Suarez is coming off, and they&#8217;ll be chanting his name back in Uruguay tonight, man of the match performance as Alvaro Fernandez takes his place. Korea have taken off Ki Sung-Yeung and brought on Yeom Ki-Hun.</p>
<p>86 Mins: Dong Gook has a great chance, but his shot goes under Muslera and doesn&#8217;t reach the goalmouth. A good chance for the Koreans that has been wasted.</p>
<p>?? Mins: I don&#8217;t know what’s happening?! My TV has broke! It&#8217;s a running live commentator&#8217;s worst nightmare!</p>
<p>92 Mins: I&#8217;m back, no Idea if anything else has happened , it doesn&#8217;t sound like anything has. Phew.</p>
<p><strong>Full Time!</strong></p>
<p>- The first ever world champions look good here and many will back them to make it to the semi finals. They&#8217;ve finally got a team that is at least decent in all areas, as opposed to the days where they relied heavily upon Recoba etc. A shame to see South Korea go, but they gave it a good go and were impressive in this World Cup. The winner will take on tonight’s victor, and I&#8217;m wondering what all you American fans make of this Uruguay team, as you could be playing them for a place in the semi-finals. Suarez didn&#8217;t exactly play amazing, but he got the two goals, and that is all you would ask for from a front man really, we&#8217;ve seen it time and time again with some of the best front men in the game, Eto&#8217;o against Chelsea this season for Inter is a good example, as he played poor all match but came out of nowhere to bang home a goal for his team. Thanks for reading, and enjoy the game tonight!</p>

Brazil 0, Portugal 0

<p><strong>Brazil 0, Portugal 0</strong></p>
<p>Brazil topped the proverbial &#8220;Group of Death&#8221; with relative ease with Portugal following them into the knockout rounds courtesy of a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>It was a day when two of the most prolific offenses in the game created a fair amount of chances and half-chances but couldn&#8217;t finish them off. Brazilian striker Nilmar&#8217;s close-range effort was pushed onto the post by Portugese goalkeeper Eduardo for the only close call of the opening half.</p>
<p>But what the first half was full of was yellow cards, seven players were cautioned during the opening period as these longtime rivals played physical soccer.</p>
<p>The second half offered a few chances but Brazil&#8217;s Julio Cesary and Eduardo showed why they are two of the best keepers in the world.</p>
<p>Brazilian manager Dunga was not impressed by Portugal&#8217;s defensive setup &#8220;&#8221;We played to win, but our opponent didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Dunga said. &#8220;We always tried to attack, but they only tried to take advantage of our mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ivory Coast 3, North Korea 0</strong></p>
<p>The Ivory Coast was unable to overcome near-impossible odds to qualify for the round of 16 but ended their World Cup campaign on a high note with a 3-0 defeat of already-eliminated North Korea.</p>
<p>The Elephants knocked in two early goals. Yaya Toure opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a fantastic shot from the top of the box. Romaric added one two minutes later on a rebound when Didier Drogba&#8217;s bullet ricocheted off the post. The Ivory Coast couldn&#8217;t score again until the 82nd minute when Salomon Kalou scored his only goal of the tournament.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our World Cup is over today,&#8221; Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba said. &#8220;But I think we can be proud of what we did against Portugal and against Brazil, even if we lost, and today.</p>
<p><strong>Spain 2, Chile 1</strong></p>
<p>Spain survived their first-round scare to win group H and avoid a second round date with Brazil with a 2-1 over Chile, the first South American team to lose in the tournament.</p>
<p>David Villa capatalized on a Chilean goalkeeping error with a shot from 45 yards out into an open net in the 24th minute. Andres Iniesta added one 37 minutes later to double Spain&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>Marco Estrada was sent off during the goal celebration for a second yellow card for tripping Fernando Torres and Chile was reduced to 10 men.</p>
<p>Rodrigo Millar&#8217;s shot deflected off Gerard Pique&#8217;s shin and into the net to bring one back for Chile but that was the last offensive moment of the game as both teams knew they would advance with a 2-1 result.</p>
<p><strong>Switzerland 0, Honduras 0</strong></p>
<p>Switzerland could not conquer Honduras and both teams are going home in the first round despite Switzerland&#8217;s surprising defeat of Spain.</p>
<p>Switzerland needed a two-goal win to advance out of group G but showed their offensive ineptitude when they are unable to counterattack. Hondruas salvaged some pride by finishing the World Cup with at least a point. It was a game of few chances with neither team looking like they wanted to make an offensive push.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an incredible Diego Benaglio who kept us in the game,&#8221; Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said. &#8220;But as far as our creative play, that&#8217;s not something I can be happy with. I&#8217;m not happy with my strikers, either.&#8221;</p>

What this World Cup has provided us so far has been, well, a bit baffling really, it has provided little in the way of genuine thrills and excitement but a huge amount of intrigue. It has been engrossing and most importantly it has provided some genuine surprises.</p>
<p>Group A was the setting for the demise of the French, no heart, no passion, no cohesion, spats, rows and fallouts equalled one point for Les Bleus and a shameful early flight home. Henry should’vedone the world a favour and kept his hand by his side. Uruguay and Mexico qualified from the group with relative ease, both sides have shown through some assured displays that they are more than capable of having a successful run in this World Cup. It was such a disappointment not to see the South Africans get through, maybe naivety, nerves and a little bit of expectation got the better of them, particularly against the Uruguayans, yet their performances either side of that game were impressive and it was a shame not to see the host nation progress. The South African squad, unlike the French, can hold their heads high.</p>
<p>Argentina somewhat strolled through Group B, winning all three games, as impressive as that looks on paper there do appear to be a few cracks in the Argentinean side, particularly at the back. As yet you couldn’t really put them down as nailed on finalists. South Korea qualified as runners up, they are a well organised outfit and create plenty of openings going forward, they make for a tricky opposition. Elsewhere in Group B Greece were Greece and Nigeria were bitterly disappointing, their campaign will only be remembered for Yakubu’s astonishing miss against the Koreans.</p>
<p>The USA claimed top spot in Group C with virtually the last kick of the group, securing a berth in arguably the easier side of the draw. It was no less than the Americans deserved, particularly after clawing their way back from two nil down in their previous match to claim a vital point. England finished runners up, after being vilified for their part in two drab draws they secured qualification with a One nil victory over Slovenia, England may live to regret not converting more of their chances, they now face a tricky route through the knockouts. Far from being spectacular Algeria and Slovenia ensured that qualification for the US and England was not as comfortable as many imagined it would be.</p>
<p>The ever efficient Germans got their World Cup off to a flying start, breezing past an awful Australian side in a four nil rout. That German efficiency went missing in game two when they fell to a one nil defeat at the hands of Serbia. Group D   like most groups was wide open going into the final round of matches. A one goal victory against the Ghanaians clinched top spot for Joachim Low’s men. Ghana finished second, salvaging some pride for what has been a poor World Cup for the African nations. To be fair there wasn’t much between the three sides that finished below the Germans, the Australians were vastly improved after their first display and the Serbs looked well organised and difficult to beat. It was Ghana’s win in their first game which proved how crucial it is to get points on the board as early as possible.</p>
<p>The Dutch waltzed to 9 points in Group E without even having to get out of second gear. Japan finished a thoroughly deserving second. Denmark and Cameroon were quite frankly awful in what was possibly the dullest group of the tournament. The Indomitable Lions, for me, have been the let down of 2010 so far.</p>
<p>Group F was home to the shock of the Tournament, Italy not only failed to qualify but finished bottom of their group. On the back of two lacklustre draws no one expected the Italians to fall short again in their last match. You have to credit the Slovakians for playing with such belief, it has to be the game of the tournament so far, and in contrast to the French, despite their shocking start the Italians fought all the way in their final game and very nearly pulled off a great escape in the dying seconds. Special mention must go to New Zealand, to finish undefeated in a group containing the Azzurri, Paraguay and Slovakia is some achievement for the All Whites and it is a shame three sides could not progress from Group F because no one would begrudge them 90 more minutes of World Cup Football.</p>
<p>Brazil finished top of the pile in Group G with Portugal qualifying as runners up. The Ivory Coast were another African disappointment and the North Koreans went from terrific to terrible in three games. Brazil look strong, their two defensive midfielders play a priceless role and have so far been fantastic, if their more creative colleagues hit form then the boys from Brazil will be the team to beat.</p>
<p>In the final group Chile continued to wave the South American flag proudly. They played with the freedom and expression expected from Group favourites Spain. The Spanish did not buck the trend of struggling European sides, leaving qualification to the last game after a less than convincing start, but they did manage to turn things around and claim top spot. Switzerland were their normal no nonsense selves, set up not to lose and not to be pleasing on the eye. I would like to say the Hondurans did more than just make up the numbers, sadly I can’t.</p>
<p>As the World Cup heads into stage two a lot of teams will try to forget their struggles in the group stages. This is the business end of the tournament and it’s game one as far as they are concerned, if you slip up now you don’t get another chance to set things right. There is still no real favourite, results wise it has been one of the most unpredictable World Cups so far, one thing we know is that every side is beatable. The form book was thrown out of the window during the group stages, and there’s no indication that will change in the knockouts.</p>

<p><strong>Slovakia 3, Italy 2</strong></p>
<p>An aging Italian defense let in three goals as the defending champions flamed out of the tournament with a shocking defeat to Slovakia.</p>
<p>The Slovakians took advantage of a disastrous turnover  by Daniele De Rossi to score in the 25th minute. De Rossi&#8217;s turnover deep in the Azzuri half was pounced upon by Slovakia. Robert Viddic beat backup goalkeeper Federico Marchetti to his right post.</p>
<p>The game remained scoreless for 50 minutes until the Italians failed to clear a Slovakian corner. Marek Hamsik found Vittek at the near post with a low cross that Vittek side-footed home to complete his brace. With 10 minutes to go Antonio Di Natale brought one back for Italy when a he put home rebound off Fabio Quagliarella&#8217;s close-range shot.</p>
<p>But Kamil Kopunek put the game beyond all doubt in the 89th minute when the Azzuri defense fell asleep on a throw in. Kopunek chipped the ball over Marchetti to seal Italy&#8217;s fate. Quagliarella brought one back in injury time but the goal served as little more than a consolation.</p>
<p><strong>New Zealand 0, Paraguay 0</strong></p>
<p>The All-Whites of New Zealand finished their World Cup campaign without losing a game but couldn&#8217;t master a win to put them into the next round against a Paraguay side who only needed a draw to assure advancement.</p>
<p>The game offered few chances as Paraguay was unwilling to commit men to the attack and New Zealand didn&#8217;t have the offensive potency to break down an entrenched defense. New Zealand couldn&#8217;t put any shots on goal and Paraguay&#8217;s few chances were easily handled by goalkeeper Mark Paston.</p>
<p>New Zealand became only the fourth team in World Cup history to not advance out of their group without losing a game and Paraguay kept South America unbeaten through 13 matches in the 2010 World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>The Netherlands 2, Cameroon 1</strong></p>
<p>Arjen Robben made his World Cup debut as The Netherlands secured top spot in their group by dispatching already-elimated Cameroon.</p>
<p>The Netherlands opened the scoring in the 36th minute when Robin Van Persie buried a through ball from Rafael Van der Vaart. The Indomitable Lions drew level in the 65th minute when Samuel Eto&#8217;o scored from the spot following a Netherlands handball.</p>
<p>But the Netherlands finished the game off with Klass-Jan Huntelaar rebound off a Robben shot.</p>
<p><strong>Japan 3, Denmark 1</strong></p>
<p>Japan advanced to the knockout rounds with a convincing 2-1 defeat of Denmark.</p>
<p>Goals by Yashutio Endo, Keisuke Honda and Shinji Okazaki gave the Blue Samurai their second win in the 2010 World Cup.</p>
