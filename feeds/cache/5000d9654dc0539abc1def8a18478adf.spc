In the wake of the furore that followed Thierry Henry's handball in France's World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland last November, Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, indicated that he was not prepared to consider video replays but might look again at goal-line technology.</p><p>Yet when the former Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith proposed that the issue be debated at the IFAB meeting, it was roundly rejected following presentations from two companies that have been working on the technology. Blatter has since been unequivocal that the debate is closed, concentrating instead on the Uefa-inspired experiment with extra officials behind each goal.</p><p>Jerome Valcke, the Fifa secretary general, reiterated Fifa's stance this week, saying that technological solutions were "not on the table" but that additional assistant referees could be introduced for the 2014 World Cup. "It doesn't mean the use of video, that is definitely not on the table today, but one thing we are discussing is two additional assistants to support referees to make decision-making easier and to have more eyes helping him to make such decisions," he said.</p><p>Explaining the decision to rule out goal-line technology, Blatter said in March that football must retain its "human aspect". "No matter which technology is applied, at the end of the day a decision will have to be taken by a human being. This being the case, why remove the responsibility from the referee to give it to someone else?" he said. "It is often the case that, even after a slow-motion replay, 10 different experts will have 10 different opinions on what the decision should have been. Fans love to debate any given incident in a game. It is part of the human nature of our sport."</p><p>England captain Steven Gerrard said the disallowed goal had an effect on the outcome of the match but that it should not be used as an excuse.</p><p>"There were big key decisions in the game, at 2-1 we had a goal disallowed. At 2-1 we were hurting them and we were still in the game," he said.</p><p>"I think it [the disallowed goal] had an effect but we cannot use that as an excuse with being beaten 4-1. That would have been a big goal for us. It's all ifs and buts. Germany are a fantastic team and they deserved their win."</p><p>Smith, who has since stepped down as the SFA chief executive, said last night: "It was not significant to the result but, even if it had been, I don't think they would change their minds. Everyone watching at home saw what happened and these situations will arise again in the future but I don't think they'll change it."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england">England</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa">The FA</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fifa">Fifa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson">Owen Gibson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:8:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"England";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"The FA";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Fifa";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Sport";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"News";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 20:56:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/27/world-cup-2010-goal-line-technology";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Owen Gibson";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T20:56:15Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364286385";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:2:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

But was left exposed too many times and, despite making good saves from Miroslav Klose and Mesut Ozil, was perhaps at fault for the second goal, when he should have done better from a tight angle.</p><h2><strong>Glen Johnson 4</strong><br /></h2>Offered little going forward and defensive frailties were all too apparent, particularly when badly caught out for the second goal.</p><h2>John Terry 4<br /></h2>Culpable, like Upson, for the first goal. His full-blooded but increasingly static style was no match for the quick feet around him.</p><h2><strong>Matthew Upson 4</strong><br /></h2>Horrendously caught out for the first goal, when Klose powered past him. The West Ham defender looked uncertain all afternoon and was repeatedly pulled out of position. His headed goal renewed hope but was not enough to compensate.</p><h2><strong>Ashley Cole 6</strong><br /></h2>Tried to get forward as he had against Slovenia but failed to do so with any effectiveness. Was caught out by Germany's repeated raids down the right in the opening stages but was offered little protection by Gerrard.</p><h2><strong>James Milner 5</strong><br /></h2>Tried to get forward and get crosses in but was well shackled and afforded little space. Unable to beat his man for pace, he too often looked inside and played a square ball instead.</p><h2><strong>Frank Lampard 6</strong><br /></h2>Drove forward and got on  the ball more often than in first three games and appeared to have found his shooting range. Was denied a legitimate goal by a linesman and may well have had two more. Now looks destined never to score a World Cup goal.</p><h2><strong>Gareth Barry 4</strong><br /></h2>Hailed as the man who would unlock the potential of this England side by providing a metronomic passing base but he failed to protect his back four or offer any base from which to build. In mitigation, may still not be fully fit.</p><h2><strong>Steven Gerrard 5</strong><br /></h2>Was unable to drive his team forward when they badly needed it, apart from a 20-minute spell either side of half-time when he was more involved. Stuck to his post on the left but was unable to influence the game.</p><h2><strong>Wayne Rooney 4</strong><br /></h2>Started more brightly, holding the ball up well and passing sharply.

"Maybe England were not prepared for this game as they should have been," he said.</p><p>"Maybe they underestimated us because our players aren't as famous as theirs. But while we have a young team, we are a good side. Their defence couldn't handle us because we have good strikers."</p><p>Steven Gerrard was as brutal with his assessment of his own side's shortcomings. "We've been beaten by the better team," he said. "We had good parts of the game where we passed the ball well and got into good areas. At 2-1, if Frank's goal would have counted it could have been a turning point in the game, but we can't use that as an excuse. They've scored four goals and we only got one, which tells its own story.</p><p>"They were more clinical in front of goal and they made less mistakes than us and we got punished for that. We made too many mistakes as a team. Germany were more organised than us and were more clinical. They got in five or six times and scored four goals, so you've got to give them credit. Germany were the better team for the 90 minutes, and the third goal was the killer.</p><p>"Everyone in the dressing room is hurting: the coaching staff and the players. We'll go away in the summer and analyse things personally, but it's very disappointing to go out at this stage. Before this game, and even during it, I had confidence we could progress. Everyone is to blame for the fact we didn't.</p><p>"We came into this tournament with big togetherness, and it would be very unfair of me to pick out individuals. For me it's the group. If we'd have won we'd have all got pats on the back so we have to take the responsibility and the grief ourselves.</p><p>"Everyone's deflated and disappointed," said John Terry. "Not much was said in there. There was just silence, really, and everyone was down because we felt, coming here, that we had a good chance. That disappoints us more than anything."</p><p>Asked whether elimination should now prompt a change of manager or playing personnel, the former captain added: "I can't believe we're even having that conversation."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england">England</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/john-terry">John Terry</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/germany">Germany</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:10:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"England";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Frank Lampard";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Steven Gerrard";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"John Terry";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Germany";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Sport";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:9;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"News";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 20:34:52 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/27/world-cup-2010-england-germany1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Dominic Fifield";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T20:36:09Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364285497";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:2:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

Fifa will be praying, after an opening goal for Argentina that looked suspiciously offside and a Mexican attempt that may have been cleared from behind the line, that no further fuel is added to the fire already started by the campaign for video replays.</p><p>When the dust had settled on an eventful encounter, the clear winners even without the aid of dodgy refereeing decisions were Argentina, who proved they do not need to rely on Lionel Messi to bamboozle opponents. Messi nearly broke his duck in stoppage time but with two goals, Carlos Tevez was just as important here. With a wealth of talent left untapped on the bench, Diego Maradona's men are going to take some stopping.The latest team-by-team news, features and more</p><blockquote><h2><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/twitter/list/worldcupstaff" title="Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter now">Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter</a><br /><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/fantasyfootball" title="Sign up now and play our great Fantasy Football game">Sign up to play our daily Fantasy Football game</a><br /><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&pstr=cup_comp&CTID=-6&cpid=-6" title="Get the lowdown on every player with our stats centre">Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player</a><br /><strong>•</strong> </h2></blockquote><p>Messi's first run, a typical carry to the edge of the area for a shot that was blocked, seemed to concentrate Mexican minds and prompt then to remember they were likely to need goals of their own. With two attempts in quick succession they twice went close to scoring in the first 10 minutes. First Carlos Salcido rattled Sergio Romero's bar with a thunderous shot from 30 yards out, one the goalkeeper did not know too much about and had in fact missed by the time it slapped against the woodwork behind him. Then Andrés Guardado came forward and played a neat one two with Giovani dos Santos, collecting the return and sending a shot narrowly wide of Romero's upright.</p><p>Both sides became more cautious after that, with Argentina passing the ball from flank to flank and Mexico happy to let them, until the game exploded into controversy midway through the first half. Messi jinked through the middle to set up a chance for Tevez, and when the Manchester City striker's shot was blocked by Oscar Pérez's dive, the rebound came out to Messi and he sent the ball goalwards. Tevez was now standing in an offside position in front of Messi, which would not have been too bad had he not stopped to nudge the ball over the line with his head. That made him active, and the referee, who may initially have missed the last contact, was immediately besieged by Mexican protests when he awarded the goal.</p><p>A long chat with his linesman followed, after which the goal was allowed to stand, much to the evident disgust of Javier Aguirre and his players. Tevez may have got lucky because two Mexican defenders had just about overtaken him by the time he headed the ball, meaning that even though he was goalside of Pérez he still may have been onside at the point of contact after all. If that was the case it was an excellent decision involving incredibly fine judgment, though Roberto Rossetti could not have been surprised to be waylaid by an angry Mexican deputation as he made his way off at half-time.</p><p>At least, as with England earlier in the day, any sense of injustice was overtaken by subsequent developments before it had a chance to rankle. There was nothing remotely controversial about Argentian's second goal, after a hideous slip by Ricardo Osorio invited Gonzalo Higuaín to steam in and round Pérez to score. The goal was Higuaín's fourth of the tournament and takes him one above David Villa in the scoring list, though he could never have imagined scoring a World Cup goal would be so easy.</p><p>Higuaín had another chance just before the interval, only to miss the target with a header. Javier Hernández could not get on the end of a promising cross moments later, though he did make full contact with Gabriel Heinze just before the whistle went, and was lucky to get away with blatantly pushing his opponent off his feet and over the touchline.</p><p>Both the first-half controversy and Mexico's World Cup ambitions were consigned to history by the authority of Argentina's third strike, and absolute screamer of a goal from Tevez that most have had both City and United fans rubbing their eyes in disbelief. Not much looked on when Tevez took a wrong turn into two Mexican defenders, until the ball rebounded kindly from the unfortunate Osorio and Tevez promptly took a snap shot from 25 yards that fairly flew past Perez. If Higuaín will never score a simpler goal, Tevez may never hit a sweeter one.</p><p>Pablo Barrera looked quite sharp when he came on, on one run beating both Nicolás Otamendi and Maxi Rodríguez before flicking a shot into the side-netting, but after Tevez's second goal Mexico were clearly only playing for pride. They won a certain amount back when Manchester United's Javier Hernández elegantly turned Martín Demichelis to score a wonderful solo consolation goal, though going out to Argentina once more was scant consolation for resigned Mexican supporters. Hernández's sparkling finish probably caused more excitement in Manchester.</p><p>Mexico put up a better show against Argentina in the last World Cup, and at no time in this game did they look like a team that believed they had a chance of winning. Germany can always provide an obstacle to World Cup progress, but Argentina look as if they believe they can go all the way.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/argentina">Argentina</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mexico">Mexico</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulwilson">Paul Wilson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Argentina";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Mexico";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Sport";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Match reports";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 20:33:28 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/27/argentina-mexico-world-cup-2010";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Paul Wilson";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T20:44:51Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364283930";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:2:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

Stamping the wooden floor they chanted: "That's how winners are, tra la la la la," and "Finale, oh oh oh oh...".</p><p>Continuing in the tradition of the headline war between the British and German red-tops, the front page of today's Bild Zeitung urged the nation to "Cheer and chill, let England grill", and that is precisely what millions across the country did.</p><p>Hundreds packed the pews at the Admiralspalast in Berlin, a Weimar-era varieté theatre and one of the city's scores of temporary World Cup public viewing venues.</p><p>"This isn't football, this is so much more when England and Germany are playing," said Joshua Müller, who had settled in a red velvet chair and draped his black, red and gold German flag over the balcony, to watch the spectacle on a huge screen.</p><p>When each of the four goals was scored, the spectators rose from their seats, threw their arms in the air and roared with such force it felt like the ceiling would lift off. The biggest jeer was reserved for the view from Bloemfontein of two English fans dressed up in what looked like German military uniforms from the first world war, whose expressions appeared inconsolable.</p><p>Over on the Kurfürstendamm avenue, a parade of cars blasted their horns, and flew the German flag from their windows and sunroofs. Turkish Germans also joined in the celebrations – a first for Berlin – as they waved both Turkish and German flags in honour of the members of the team with Turkish heritage, Özil and Serdar Tasci.</p><p>On Berlin's official "fan mile", between the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column, up to 500,000 fans were estimated to have gathered. They turned the six-lane street into a sea of black, red and gold in ecstatic scenes that were repeated in towns and cities across the country.</p><p>Bushido, one of Germany's biggest rap stars, appeared to perform his hit song Flames in the Wind, which became the team's unofficial anthem when it was brought into their dressing room early on in the tournament by the midfielder Sami Khedira. The crowds roared when he sang: "The German team fights and Germany fevers with them."</p><p>Rarely has Germany been in such an outwardly confident mood about winning a World Cup match. Despite its record, there has always been a particular nervousness about playing England. But this time the newspapers, although they took several days to warm up, gave as good as they got from the British tabloids.</p><p>They responded to headlines about "jeering jerries" and "the war machine", with their own. Yesterday's Welt am Sonntag referred to the encounter as "An almighty battle but without the steel helmets", while another declared: "Hello summer, bye bye England".</p><p>It was indeed one of the hottest days of the year and around Berlin, medical teams were working flat out to take care of the hundreds of fans who collapsed in sweltering temperatures due to sunstroke and dehydration.</p><p>In the coolness of the Admiralspalast and outside in the sweltering heat of its courtyard, copious amounts of beer, bratwurst and pretzels were consumed as fans soaked up the atmosphere that was reminiscent of the summer of 2006 when Germany hosted the World Cup.</p><p>There was some sympathy for England's unrecognised second goal, but the only cheer for anything English was the sight of Mick Jagger spotted in the crowd at Bloemfontein.</p><p>"I feel strangely sympathetic towards England, especially with the lost goal. But Germany played with such panache, it's one of those rare occasions I can say I'm extremely proud to be German." said Frauke Schmidt, a producer. "But it feels like they raised their game purely and simply because they were playing against our great rivals England, and for that I'm truly grateful."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england">England</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/germany">Germany</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kateconnolly">Kate Connolly</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"England";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Germany";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"UK news";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:28:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"News";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 19:31:46 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/27/world-cup-germany-rejoice-england";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Kate Connolly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T19:31:46Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364284382";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

He wasn't talking about the fall but about England's dismal performance. "I'm angry and frustrated. Angry at the disallowed Lampard goal but frustrated that players wearing the England shirt can't do better than that. By the end there was no pride. Pathetic."</p><p>In the fan parks in Bristol and Manchester, in pubs and bars across the UK, at Glastonbury and in Bloemfontein there were complaints about the officials who missed a perfectly good goal – but also fury at England's players and manager.</p><p>"They should have sent Beckham on in his posh suit and waistcoat," said Jo Allen, another distraught fan leaving the fan park in Bristol. "I came here because I couldn't bear watching it with my eight-year-old, who's football mad ... I can hardly stand going home now and having to talk to him about it. England were just terrible. I see pub teams every week defending better than that."</p><p>In the UK the build-up had a different  rhythm to earlier match days. Ahead of the team's afternoon game against Slovenia on Wednesday, workers had left the office or factory early and charged home or into the pub, whereas today  there was more time to prepare.</p><p>In pubs across the country, England fans lined their stomachs with Sunday lunches and sank a few pints to steady the nerves. Cinemas, arenas and theatres put on special showings of the game.</p><p>Organisers of other events made sure there was a chance to keep up with the action. A big screen was set up on Cleeve Hill in Gloucestershire, where 3,000 scouts were meeting. Green-fingered residents in Shepreth, Cambridgeshire, invited visitors to a gardens festival into their living rooms, and at Glastonbury up to 80,000 football fans took time out from the music to watch the game on two giant screens. Gary Smith opted to stay and watch the legendary rock guitarist Slash: "It's a choice between two good acts, but Slash is probably more likely to deliver," he said. He was right.</p><p>There had been excitement and nerves in Bloemfontein ahead of the game as England fans, some wearing red and white bowler hats and faux wartime helmets, took over the waterfront area.</p><p>Among them was Darren Wright, from Reading, who gave up his job as a market analyst to come to the World Cup. "I've supported England long enough to know not to get my hopes up," he said. "We're going to lose on penalties, aren't we?"</p><p>It was much worse than that. At half-time fans in Bloemfontein were trying to understand how Lampard's goal had been missed. Mark McGraw, a ground worker from Nottingham, said: "It's a joke. The linesman was half way up the pitch. They're trying to get us back for '66."</p><p>But England fans leaving the stadium after the game were distraught. Darren Garner, a digger driver from Peterborough, said: "They just don't seem to have the heart. We're supposed to be three lions. We looked old and useless."</p><p>Anger was also aimed at England manager Fabio Capello. Graham Langworthy, from Margate, said: "Capello has bottled it. He hasn't made any good substitution decisions the whole tournament. We should have been playing in a better formation."</p><p>It will console few that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, admitted that Lampard's disallowed goal was over the line and told David Cameron she was sorry it did not stand. The two leaders watched the second half of the match together at the G20 summit in Toronto.</p><p>Cameron said: "The country will wonder 'what if?' after Frank Lampard's disallowed goal, but it was a disappointing result. At least we were all spared the agony of penalties."</p><p>The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said: "This was a disappointing end to a tournament in which England hardly ever performed."</p><p>So are there any silver linings? Travel companies may enjoy a boom time. In the past there has been a rush for the nearest airport when England are booted out of a tournament. Bookmakers may also be relieved. An England win would have cost them £50m or more. William Hill said it would pay out to fans who had put money on Frank Lampard scoring anyway.</p><p>In Bloemfontein, fans' thoughts turned to home. Pilot Tom Stoddart, 31, from Eastbourne, Kent, said: "I've been here three weeks, spent too much money and seen too much atrocious football ... England didn't deserve to win. The mood in the crowd is so flat. It feels too early to be going home."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england">England</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/germany">Germany</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/glastonbury">Glastonbury festival</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson">Owen Gibson</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevenmorris">Steven Morris</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenpidd">Helen Pidd</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping">Alexandra Topping</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:9:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"England";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Germany";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Sport";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Glastonbury festival";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"UK news";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:28:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"News";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 19:14:59 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/27/england-germany-world-cup-fans-reaction";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"Owen Gibson, Steven Morris, Helen Pidd, Alexandra Topping";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T19:14:59Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364283858";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:2:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

But let us be generous, for once, and say without irony that a bunch of gifted footballers finally disappeared into a Free State sunset last night. Although their deeds in the shirt of the national team may never have matched their promise, what they accomplished in the colours of some of the world's biggest clubs certainly validated their authenticity as individuals. If they failed to bring home the expected trophies from international tournaments, at least they gave us plenty to talk about.</p><p>The truth is that they had been slipping away, one by one, for some time before the end came last night. The first of the core members to take his leave was Paul Scholes, whose disillusionment led him to retire from international football after the 2004 European Championships. Next went Michael Owen, his England career ended by an inability to persuade Fabio Capello that his full effectiveness had been restored after a series of debilitating injuries. The third was David Beckham, who had regained the coach's trust but whose Indian summer was ruined by an achilles tendon injury in March. Then Rio Ferdinand was abruptly excluded from participation in the 2010 World Cup by a twisted knee in a training session eight days before England's opening match.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/twitter/list/worldcupstaff" title="Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter now">Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter</a><br /><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/fantasyfootball" title="Sign up now and play our great Fantasy Football game">Sign up to play our daily Fantasy Football game</a><br /><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&pstr=cup_comp&CTID=-6&cpid=-6" title="Get the lowdown on every player with our stats centre">Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player</a><br /><strong>•</strong> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/world-cup-2010-teams" title="All of the latest team-by-team news, features and more">The latest team-by-team news, features and more</a></h2></blockquote><p>Now, following yesterday's defeat by Germany, the chances are that we have also seen the last of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard at a major international competition. Both can look forward to years of useful life at club level but their lease on an England shirt has expired and whoever picks up the threads left by Capello will need to be thinking in terms of a fresh start.</p><p>Gerrard and Owen are 30, Lampard and Ferdinand 32, Beckham and Scholes (whom Capello, at his wits' end, tried to recall) 35. They made their senior international debuts between 1995 and 2000 and share an aggregate of 421 caps, which would have been many more but for injuries, a long suspension and Scholes's self-imposed exile. In football terms they are now senior citizens. Advances in kinesiology and other fitness sciences mean they will be with us for a while yet but no longer as the standard bearers for a perhaps unwisely expectant nation.</p><p>Together they symbolised England's hopes of turning the Premier League's astonishing global popularity into a second World Cup trophy in the FA's cabinet. At the start of their journey they were young, gifted and – with the exception of the admirably stubborn Scholes – hugely marketable, but now it can be seen that their pinnacle probably came that sunny late afternoon in Shizuoka, when they faced Brazil in the quarter-finals of the 2002 tournament in front of 47,436 spectators whose replica shirts were divided equally between the white of the European side and the yellow of the South Americans.</p><p>The vast majority of those fans were Japanese, and the ones who had elected to support England were, almost to a man, woman and child, wearing the names of Owen or Beckham inscribed on their backs. Those old enough to remember the Beatles' impact on Japan, almost 40 years earlier, identified a similar popular culture phenomenon. Owen gave England the lead and in that moment they seemed fully the equals of the best side in the world. Had Beckham or Scholes succeeded in preventing the move from which Rivaldo scored the equaliser or had Ronaldinho's audacious free-kick not been allowed to dip under David Seaman's crossbar, history might have been very different.</p><p>After that defeat the climate changed. Anticipation was no longer untainted by apprehension. At home the excitement grew greater every time they set off for a World Cup but underneath it was a feeling that disappointment would not be far away. The fans believed, and did not believe. They were prepared to give unconditional support while reserving the right to castigate those who failed to fulfiltheir dreams, even though most of them knew, deep down, that those dreams were no longer realistic. Their apprehension was shared and after their first two matches in South Africa even Capello was speaking of the "fear" of the tournament exhibited by these highly experienced players.</p><p>The immoderate affluence of the leading Premier League players began to turn the leaders of the golden generation into easy targets and at the 2006 World Cup they allowed themselves and their entourage to become a laughing stock. A sense of entitlement finally overwhelmed what had once been a bunch of ordinary lads, essentially no different from, and no less talented than, those assembled by Alf Ramsey in 1966.</p><p>It distorted their behaviour off the pitch and led them to believe that success on it was no more than they "deserved" – the most popular word in their lexicon when, after losing a penalty shoot-out to Portugal, they were lamenting the premature departure from their luxury headquarters in the hills of the Black Forest as though the talent and superior motivation of lower-ranked teams were some sort of offence against nature.</p><p>So the era that began on a hot June night in France 12 years ago with a flash of lightning – Owen's scamper through the Argentinian defence – and a roll of thunder – Beckham's red card – is finally over. Now we can see how that defeat in Saint-Etienne defined the generation: a moment of deserved exhilaration closely followed by the confrontation with catastrophe. And when the end came, it was a real <em>coup de grâce</em>, appropriately flavoured with controversy and delivered by merciless opponents.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england">England</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/richardwilliams">Richard Williams</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"England";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Sport";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Comment";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 18:10:11 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/jun/28/england-golden-generation-world-cup-2010";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Richard Williams";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T18:10:11Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364281850";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:2:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

In fact, about the only place free of football paraphernalia was an eerily empty spot around the corner from the Dance Village normally reserved for staff camping. On Saturday this area was one of the few places you could swing a jester's hat without taking a steward's eye out. But on Sunday afternoon more than 30,000 England fans took a break from gigging to squint at a big screen perched atop a lorry there. As the sage words of Alan Hansen boomed across the field, the party atmosphere turned to despair with England's painful defeat.</p><p>The day before, an implausibly huge crowd had assembled for the Lightning Seeds' midday slot on the Pyramid stage. After 45 minutes of mild applause, Ian Broudie softly started singing "It's coming home", and the sun-pelted fans sprang up to yell along to Three Lions. This  afternoon, we wondered why he bothered.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/glastonbury">Glastonbury festival</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010">World Cup 2010</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/willdean">Will Dean</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our <a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html">Terms & Conditions</a> | <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds">More Feeds</a></div><p style="clear:both" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Glastonbury festival";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"World Cup 2010";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Football";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:34:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:37:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/publication";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Features";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:30:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 18:00:17 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jun/27/glastonbury-world-cup-lightning-seeds";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Will Dean";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Music";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-06-27T18:00:17Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Article";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"identifier";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"364278071";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:2:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:25:"

Feel like a change of pace from all that frantic Northern European hoof-punt Hollywood-pass counter-attack blitzkrieg-launch wild flailing scuffled high-stepping knee-pumping chest-out bicep-flexing wild yelping 150%-giving blood-on-the-shirt-spilling crazed fist-pumping-team-talk-giving humped to the back stick flicked on by the big man six-man wrestling match by the corner flag malarky? <br />Me too.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>6.59pm:</strong> Instead of all that, here we have a refreshingly Latin-ate affair. Possession will, most likely, be nurtured. Small, wily men will shuttle silkily sideways. Openings will be teased. The ball will be kept for longer than five frantical eye-bulging seconds. </p><p>And also Argentina will be tested properly for the first time. I have already been mocked by some members of this organ's online community for suggesting Mexico have a chance tonight. I'm still not sure why: Mexico are a solid team with pace on the flanks. Perhaps they lack a really deadly forward. But Argentina have definitely got a <em>stuff-up in them somewhere</em>. They are not a flawless machine, but instead an optimistic team built on its forward strengths and the belief in setting out attempting to win rather than avoiding defeat. </p><p>With England out, I could quite happily follow either of these two (gone off Holland; and unmoved by all the urgings to support Ghana solely for reasons of African-ness).</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> Sarah Rothwell notes:" I'm guessing they're talking about his jumping ability, but I still can't visualize Oscar "El Conejo" Perez as a rabbit.  Maybe he's taken to asking "What the #$@% up with this Doc?" because his sub on the bench (and predecessor) has all the big name endorsement deals if the ads on Univision are anything to go by." I think it's the teeth. He is a peculiar specimen: oddly chubby-looking but still massively agile. It's a neat combo.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>7.13pm:</strong> Lovely shots of Maradona waltzing off the team bus like a small, sweating, nimble-footed, oiled and mulletted gaucho good time boy. He seemed to be singing something. The man is having an extremely good time.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>7.18pm:</strong> Here the teams:<br /><strong>Argentina:</strong> Romero, Demichelis, Burdisso, Heinze, Otamendi, Di Maria, Mascherano, Maxi, Higuain, Messi, Tevez<br /><strong>Mexico: </strong>Perez, Rodriguez, Salcido, Marquez, Osorio, Juarez, Torrado, Guardado, Hernandez, Giovani, Bautista<br />So Hernandez of Manchester United stars in favour of the sorry Blanco. And Messi, Tevez and Higuain will scamper with purpose up front for Argentina. What a wonderful attack that is, with Di Maria behind them too.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>7.22pm:</strong> Very glad this game is on now - and with these two teams. There is always an odd deflation when England go out, even when they absolutely deserved it and were nothing but tournament also-rans. Hopefully a nice cleansing of the palate is in store. The players are walking out to the weirdly childish World Cup oompah-style anthem. Argentina have the carefree swagger of a group of men off out on their way to a night club.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>7.24pm:</strong> Anthems. Maradona looks tearful and, peculiarly, as ever a lot like my equally well-groomed and piously chubby-faced Hungarian grandmother. the Mexican anthem is as ever a foot-stomping Sergio Leone Western-inflected joy.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>7.27pm:</strong> Ramya Mohan notes: "I removed Messi from my fantasy teams- surefire way of getting him to score". He seems due, the scamp. Mexico will be extremely tight on him in midfield. I imagine they will try to keep it scoreless for a bit.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>7.29pm:</strong> On Maradona resembling family members Raj Datta writes: "The day after The Goal my dad (then 55) got a call from a longlost friend from college days - who had called to say Maradona looked, and PLAYED like Dad."  I'm glad it's not just me. Anyone else?</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>1 mins:</strong> Mexico kick off and, oddly attempt a kind of mid-1990s Premier League punt down the left wing. It doesn't work. It looks like Marquez is on Messi, just in front of the back four. He wins the ball and tries to feed the scampering sulky teenage girl-a-like Dos Santos, but it runs out of play.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Mexico keep the ball for a bit, scuttling neatly in midfield. They look agreeably bandy-legged in their long white socks. And they have such ease on the ball. The excellent (here) Dos Santos in particular seems as good an example as you'd need that Premier League and international football are very different. Meanwhile, "I suspect that, despite Nike's continuing influence on my television, the percentage of English lads born with the name Wayne will be decreasing in the near future.  As will the use of the names David, John, Matthew, Jamie, Glen, James, Aaron, Frank, Steven, Emile, Ashley and (thank god) Gareth," notes Clay Campbell, whose parents liked The Wire.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Play has stopped while the ref signals for someone to clean an enormous streamer off the pitch. Perez does it while hundreds of stewards watch and refuse to help, presumably all taking time out from their day jobs in the Wandsworth branch of Argos. We're back on again.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>8 mins:</strong> first glimpse of Messi coming forward and running right at the heart of the Mexican defence in thrilling fashion, but he's up and forced out to the left and eventually stopped. And... wow down the other end in a jiffy and Salcido hits the bar with an absolutely spanked shot from about 30 yards. that was dipping and I think it was tipped on to the bar by Romero. Then moments later Guardado breaks down the left and fires a very neat, low backlift shot that fizzes just by the post. Brilliant little spell from Mexico .</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>11 mins:</strong> This is a lovely game already. Very lose and open, with both teams attacking in numbers. Mexico are in now way over-awed. They're whatever the opposite is - under-awed, or maybe even simply awed. Messi has a little mazy and inks a hopeful chip that the leaping Perez palms down a bit unconvincingly. Kim Lima wonders: "Doesn't Maradona look a bit like Erik Estrada "Ponch" of CHIPs?" As does, or did, my aged Hungarian grandmother.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Argentina have the game's first corner, whihc ends up with Di Maria having a shot that Burdisso misses out on deflecting goalwards with his heel. Mexico break quickly and Hernandez makes some space before slicing a powerful shot that flies wide. He is a fine player. Reminds me of Ole Solskjaer a bit. And controversy: Will Oliver purrs: "Have Argentina been playing in blue shorts before now? It's a nice look." While Pangeran Siahaan splutters: "Is it just me or Argentina's blue trunks look like a contender for World Cup fashion crime?" I quite like them. They look a bit like swimming shorts.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>16 mins:</strong> Some really heavy tackles flying in on Messi by the way. The ref has already had a word, but clearly this is a bit of a tactic. So long as it's hard but fair, I think it;s a good one. No doubt Messi gets a fair amount of protection Barcelona. Mexico are going to test his mettle, but he is a brave player too. Things have settled down a bit. Some of that "possession football" we hear so much about going on. No. Beats me too.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>19 mins: </strong>Argentina briefly dominating possession. They have a greta rhythm across midfield. And Michael Aston is drinking it all in like a woman in an advert blissfully sniffing a particularly cheap and nasty air freshening spray: "WOW, this game is mighty entertaining and  as you say, quite the tonic after todays humiliation, it's not fair that they pass and control the ball so well tho'"</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>22 mins:</strong> Yes, Michael Aston, I consider it cheating. Perez hoofs the ball right through to Romero. and a breather is being taken here. It is utterly removed from what we saw earlier. Some people out there are even <em>not running around all the time</em>. Heinze does well to get forward but he can't win a corner.  Rory Saunders points out :"Good job there are no over hyped players from the Nike advertising campaign on show here tonight....(Ribery, Cannavaro, Rooney, Ronaldinho isn't even there, next is Ronaldo to crash out after a meek performance against Spain)". And Patrick Cullen has briefly unlatched his doors of perception :"In another, slightly different and possibly better reality, I'd like to see Argentina in white shorts and  Mexico in red ones, I think they'd go well with those green shirts they've got. That's a nice green..."</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>24 mins:</strong> Guardado bumps into Messi again and in fact barges him over. Free kick. Messi will not be put off by this. But will it disrupt him? Not exactly a hatchet job being carried out, but lots of hustling.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>26 mins:</strong> <strong>ARGENTINA SCORE!</strong> Carlos Tevez gets it. Messi was at the heart of it. A lovely little pass through to Tevez, the ball is blocked by Perez, Messi dinks it forward again and Tevez nods it in. Looking at the replays, however, Tevez was clearly offside. A mass of Mexican players protest. But the goal will stand, albeit wrongly so.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Amazing scenes here. Mexico are furious about the goal, which should not have been allowed, and which was almost, for a second or two, in the process of being chalked off after a replay was shown on the big screen. That is also not allowed of course. Marquez is booked for a foul on Messi. I'm afraid it's another technology-debate-stoking balls-up.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>30 mins: </strong>Marquez goes in very hard again on Tevez and he's going to have ot be very careful. Might have been off for that. This is a terrible blow for Mexico. It's hard enough stopping Argentina score legitimate goals and they had done very well for the opening half hour. Kester Lovelace, who has emerged from the pages of a Los Angeles 1950s detective novel, asks "was Tevez more offside than Lampard's shot was over the line?" About the same.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>33 mins:</strong> <strong>ARGENTINA SCORE AGAIN!</strong> Terrible mistake by Osorio. Really awful. Like something out of a grainy bloopers DVD. But greta work from Higuain too as he picks up an embarrassingly scuffed attempt at a sideways pass 30 yards from goal, skips forward , rounds the keeper and slips it in. He's scored again and Argentina, with some help, are all over this now.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>35 mins:</strong> Mexico are pouring forward, but a little frantically. Argentina break quickly and, blimey, Osorio makes another terrible mistake, giving the ball straight to Tevez, who skips forward and floats a cross over that just evades Messi six yards out. Mexico really do need to calm down. Instead they're nearly three down as Di Maria breaks through on the left and has a fine low shot that Perez dives to palm away. Cripes. This could be a walloping. Howard Davies notes lugubriously, "With all these missed referee decisions its a good thing this isn't  a major tournament. I'm sure FIFA will have it all sorted out when something important is on the line."</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Free kick to Mexico near the corner of the Argentina box, but Guardado smashes it over the bar. Every single Mexican looks a bit crazed right now. They have been hard done by but they need to have a moment and relax a little. Gary Naylor is cross: "Officiating started poorly and has got worse and worse. I have never seen it so bad in 36 years. I find it, literally, unbelievable that these errors are being made." Is it worse? This always happens. We just seem to jump on it more now. Bjorn Lubbers for example: "being a supporter of the German side, I was deeply embarrassed by the goal which wasn't given. Now when the ref between Mexico and Argentine walked to his linesman, for a fraction of a second I thought we might have a life introduction of live video evidence.. watching the linesman obviously receiving instructions (was he?) I thought FIFA might grow a backspine at last.. only to see the shameful decision for a goal that was indeed offside."</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>42 mins:</strong> Tevez is fouled again. He and Messi will have white and blue striped legs at the end of this. And Higuain should have scored there. A lovely cross from the right by Maxi Rodriguez, Higuain rises unmarked and his header is skewed horribly wide of the far post. to channel Geoff Boycott for a moment, my ancient and in fact deceased Maradona-lookalike Hungarian grandmother could have put that away.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>44 mins:</strong> Juarez has been getting some joy against Heinze on the left. that is perhaps Mexico's best hope. And Silver Fox is getting carried away :"If today doesn't bring about changes in the use of technology for disputed goals then nothing will. Human error has led to the destiny of 2 games being altered." That is perhaps not strictly true. Germany were vastly superior to England today. It was a terrible mistake but they would have won that game either way.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>45+1 mins:</strong> Best chance of the half for Mexico. The excellent Salcido puts in a lovely cross that Hernandez gets a toe on hurtling forwards, but the ball flies straight into the midriff of Romero. A bit lucky that. Could have changed things significantly before half time.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>45+2 mins:</strong> <strong>HALF TIME.</strong> Mexico walk off protesting to the officials and, oh blimey, it's all kicking off down on the Argentina bench as the Mexicans walk past. Maradona leaps in and appears to be playing the peace-maker. And there we are: Argentina are well ahead in this game now. But the talk will all be about the mistake for the goal.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p>Simon McDonnell is, meanwhile, having his own technological drama: "Sitting in a Ryanair plane on the tarmac in girona airport north of Barca following your commentary. We've taken off once and returned due to bird strike. Second take off abandoned due to distressed child. I'm relaying developments in the game to my fellow passengers. The air steward has just begun his third safety demonstration and invited us to join in! Spirit of the blitz, etc. One passanger has speculated that the plane actually crashed and we are now in hell! Come on Mexico!" Watch it. Ryanair will charge you for that.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p>So, just for the record: Mexico have been robbed here. The opening goal was offside. Against protocol there was an instant replay on the big screen. For a second it looked like the ref would change his mind. Then he sobered up and didn't. Cue endless debates about technology and also a mini riot as the teams traipsed off. Back in ten mins.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p>Geoffrey Smith writes:" "Yes, Germany started better and yes they ended miles better, and yes they've been better than England ever since they arrived in South Africa but you cannot just assume they would have kept their nerve after giving up a two-goal lead in the space of three minutes. Goals change matches." They pretty much <em>are</em> matches. But it seemed clear, I thought, Germany were far more likely to get more of them whatever England did - as they did.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p>Roy Allen hits back at Gary Naylor's nay-saying: "Contrary to the incessant whinging from the high horse merchants the officiating at this world cup has been very good. Today we have seen two very bad mistakes but in the past two weeks we have heard a lot of ill-informed bleating about good decisions. Gary Naylor has rarely been more wrong. I'm with you; refereeing has improved, but whinging about it has reached new heights."</p><!-- Block 34 --><p>Art Delano writes, a little desperately: "Here in southeast Michigan we've been under severe thunderstorm warnings for an hour, and there have been tornado funnel clouds spotted in multiple towns, and there are large-scale power blackouts. Even worse, the local broadcaster carrying the game, after interrupting multiple times to report on storm activity, has been knocked off the air. We now have to watch the match on the Spanish-language Univision channel. The last I would have no problems with if I spoke Spanish. But please keep in mind that for many of us you are the only means by which we can make sense of what's going on between Argentina and Mexico right now." Righto. noted.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p>And John Cashman argues: "I think Maradona looks more like post-spiderhole Saddam Hussein than Ponch Estrada."</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> <strong>Argentina kick off again.</strong> And Buatista is off, replaced by Barrera on on the left wing. An attacking move. He's a livewire. Barrera instantly wins a corner but Torrado's kick is easily headed away. Good positive start though. And Hank Janson has the right idea: "it is certainly time for FIFA to implement technology to betterr the quality of officiating, barney. now, when do they start on developing the technology to knock 20 years of pierluigi colina?"</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Absolute howler from long-haired prancing fraud Di Michelis, presenting the ball straight to Hernandez, but he does well to get back inside his own box and block his shot. There is hope for Mexico in that Argentina backline. They are far from impermeable. john Delany growls from beneath his trilby: "Art Delano would be my adopted name if I ever became a salso trumpet player." And William Booth fumes: "Delano is talking out of his Art. Referring and line-running at this world cup has been dreadful. Three things are spoiling the tournament - incorrect decisions, diving/exaggeration, and unpunished bad tackling, and they are all to some extent the fault of the officials."</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>51 mins:</strong> Barrera is making a few things happen on the left wing. He gets into some space again but his dinked ball goes to the back post when all the green shirts have crowded the near. Argentina have yet to really get going this half.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>52 mins:</strong> <strong>ARGENTINA SCORE! 3-0.</strong> Well. They have now. That is an absolutely brilliant strike by Tevez. The ball falls to him after a bit of a muddle 25 yards out, he sizes up the moment and spanks it first time with awesome power into the top corner, making at least three people within earshot of this commentator emit an involuntary "Oooayaeea!" sound. The keeper had no chance at all. That was stunning. Maradona does a James Brown style freak out, and quite rightly too.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>54 mins: </strong>So. Going they are. Mexico look downcast now and the stadium is a riot of blue and white bed-sheet waving. Argentina are simply irresisitible in attack, I think we can say they would be fine champions. Tevez is almost in for a hat trick after another mix-up by the Mexican defence but Juarez gets back to rob him at the last. Oh dear. Mexico really are having one I'm afraid.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Mexico really struggling to keep it together here. If you can get a look at that Tevez goal. Sure to cheer you up if you watched the England-related events with any snese of eager expectation.On England and the Lampard non-goal Pavan Jeswani barks: "I despise the England team as much as every other person on the planet who is not English, but if that goal was given, England wouldn't have had to press forward as much and wouldn't have been so fragile on the break.  It might not have changed the result, but you do not know that for certain.  This isn't getting published is it?" But Nick Smith disagrees: "Re: England- surely there are two points about todays game; 1 even if the goal stood it would have masked deep structural defects in the English game; 2 Englands Brave John Jerry is a glorified stopper and nothing more. When he's not even doing that he's just a cockney tit being paid 120K for appearing in tabloids. We may as well play Jordan at centre back."</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>60 mins:</strong> Brilliant play by Berrera on the left wing, beats two men, nutmegging Burdisso, but then shoots from a very tight angle and hits the side netting. He had three green shirts to aim for there. That was sprightly. Guardado comes off. Franco comes on against his semi-compatriots. And it would be nice if Mexico could rustle up a goal here. Salcido has a pop from miles out and it's on target and Romero flies to his right to palm it round, ponytail flapping wildly.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>63 mins:</strong> Hernandez gets up well but head powerfully over from the resultant corner. He has a nice sprightly spring and a pleasantly eager face. I predict success in the Premier League (or more likely Carling Cup and occasional Champions League dead rubber). And Jeremy James sums up the general - but I have to say, not my - view of all this: "Two absolutely appalling decisions that have wrecked two quarter finals. FIFA need to get their act together - if not technology, at the least four linesemen who understand the rules and/or a second ref watching the television who can tell the field ref when he has cocked up. What is going on makes a travesty of the game. Sod 'to err being human.'"</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Mexico continue to huff and grouch and meander and generally lose their way, albeit in an elegant and neatly stitched kind of way. Shame to see them going out, but this is largely a young team and should get better. This is now a game of pass and dink and jink and stroll. And Gary Naylor rages back :The officiating has been dismal because the big calls have been wrong too often. Many penalties have not been awarded (remember David Villa being tripped in Spain's first game?) Red cards have been awarded for minor, even non-existent offences (Kaka, Cahill). Still - at least they start the games<br />when the adverts finish."</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>69 mins:</strong> Tevez strolls off and the wonderfully aged, strolling, leggy Veron is on. Maradona hugs Tevez and buries his nose hungrily in his soaking mane.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>70 mins:</strong> Mexico so close to scoring: the ball comes in from the right wing and is headed goalwards by Franco but Heinze heads it off the line, just as the ball appears to be crossing it, and that is a good decision. Close, but we really don't need another of those.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>71 mins:</strong> <strong>MEXICO SCORE! 3-1</strong>. Lovely, really lovely goal by Hernandez. Turns brilliantly away from Di Michelis, jinks into the box, makes a bit more space and then absolutely spanks it into the top corner at the near post. That was brilliant finishing. He's a really tasty player. And Mexico have some new vim out there now.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p>73 mins: Well, nothing is impossible and Mexico are re-invigorated. You did feel when Tevez came off there was some slightly too early backslapping going on. Messi has also done nothing this half. Elsewhere John Delaney sagely notes: "On England and the Lampard non-goal; If it did go in and England managed to sneak a win against Germany can you imagine the gaping width and depth of the new [hem-de-hem orifice censorship activated] that Argentina would tear us in the quarter finals?" indeed. A big one indeed.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>76 mins:</strong> Mexico have had a good spell of possession besides the goal, but perhaps more a case of a loss of focus by Argentina. There's Messi at last, off on a mazy, wiffling dribble that comes to nought. And Keenan Robbins spits: "No one really thinks Maradona is coaching this team, do they? One of the 'assistants' (blanking on the name) is clearly giving instructions to substitutes before they go in and, one can only assume, drawing up the tactics as well." Carlos Bilardo is the man, I hear.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>78 mins:</strong> The Championship's Jonas Gutierrez is about to come on. And to be fair to Messi he has come inside a bit to find the ball and he's having some decent possession, slowing things down quite deliberately. Gutierrez is on for Di Maria. And Lou Roper summarises: "The 'offside' Argentinian goal is particularly insufferable 1) because Signor Rosetti is another highly overrated Italian referee (as in Collina) who makes a great show of 'imposing himself' and then commits howlers; and 2) it rewards serial cheaters Tevez and you-know-who. In terms of England, despite Lampard's 'goal', a 1-2 half-time scoreline does not, it seems to me unrecoverable unless you are employing a number of has-beens or never-weres in your XI.  Oh."</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>81 mins:</strong> Salcido finds great pampas plains of space on the left wing and puts in a cross that is deflected for a corner. Barerra takes a short one and puts in a lovely cross that floats though the six-yard box and is eventually headed clear by Heinze. Really good defending that. Looked a certain goal. Brave stuff too as he received a swipe on the conk for his troubles. and Ian M is watching the BBC: "Is anyone else fed up with the constant, sarky sniping at Maradona by Lineker et al? It's just so irritating...none of them have achieved half of what maradona has in the game , what do they have to be smug about?" Linker might have a proper gripe. I believe Seedorf called him " a great person", which I find cheering.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>84 mins:</strong> Heinze is in a bit of pain here. He likes his great heroic Superman-style dives a lot. He does another here, hurtling through the air like some leotarded human cannon ball and landing on his, ahem, glutes. He struggles to his feet looking ruffled. James Cantarella, like an inner city Baltimore street hobo, likes an easy fix: "Each team gets 3 "challenges" per game, if the refs initial call is upheld, the team loses a substitution. If it's reversed, then everyone will at least feel confident that the right call was made. Crap calls have far too much influence on the game to not do something about them. This is an *easy* fix."</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Just looking at Hernandez's goal again: it is a real cracker. He is extremely nimble on his feet. Here's Salcido again having perhaps his 6th or 7th shot of the night but this is a real brick and it flies miles wide. David Keith is sceptical:" "Still not convinced by this argie side, their defense looks pretty rank, especially from set pieces and but for some culpable refereeing and daft mistakes, their frontline has generally been dealt with with ease." Hmm. Not sure about that. They have looked irresistible sparingly. Romero flumps down on another over-hit Mexican through pass, almost ruffling his immaculately sculpted beard.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>89 mins:</strong> Mexico, let it be said, are finishing the stronger here and they deserve some credit for their gumption. Really hard to tell what would have happened if that goal had been disallowed. It did throughly discombobulate them. The game was even at the time. But Argentina still managed to make them pay for their wobble and they deserve some credit for that. And there's Messi finally having a shot after jibbling though two tackles. His shot is palmed over quite easily. And anonymous pretty much sums up my feelings on Maradona, although without the real hate: "I used to hate the guy. Like a real hater. The more I look at him though, standing there in his suit with his stomach staple, cocaine nose and tax debts, the more I think - this man had a hell of a crack at life." Got to love him. He is pure crazed enthusiasm.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>90+1 mins:</strong> <strong>FULL TIME.</strong> <strong>And Argentina have won 3-1. </strong> The best team won, in the end, but they won with some unnecessary extra help. Mexico will feel scandalised by the opening goal, but there was some lovely stuff after that and two fine goals from Tevez and Hernandez. Argentina will play Germany in the quarters and that really will be something. Thanks for all your emails and that's all from me for now.
